We have to create listening interface (WAN ---beacuse most of threats come here)

Enable packet captures---> Tick

Home Net and External Net(used to block private IP's other than our LAN private IP's)---> are used while defining rules

Services ---> Snort ---> Snort Interface-->WAN Rules

Category Selection: Custom.rules (Here we write rules---> Same rules are used by snort and suricata)

Everything in small case
here we cane use $home net and $external net in for ip's (source or destination)

```
alert <protocol till transport layer(tcp,udp,icmp)> <source-ip> <source-port> ->/<> <destination-ip> <destination-port> <parameters>
```
Content: To look for word in the packet
->/<> ---> either of this direction is used
paramenters : (msg:"log message about detected activity";sid:1000001;)
eg: dos attack detected, ping attack detected
sid: snort id given to rule(7 or 8 digit no) ; after everything
