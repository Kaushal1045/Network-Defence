1. To use iptables firewall we must disable firewalld first (But in the backend Firewalld is using Netfilter Only)
Firewalld relies on Netfilter (via iptables or nftables) to function.

```
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

```
sudo systemctl stop firewalld
```


```
sudo systemctl disable firewalld	
```
	after reboot it should not start automatically

```
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

2. Enable IP_Forwarding = 1 (Temporary/Permanent)

To allow ip forwarding (i.e to set it to 1)

```
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```
	0
```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```
OR
```
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

But this is temporary

To permanently allow ip forwarding (i.e to set it to 1)

```
sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
```
	net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1

Apply the changes immediately without rebooting by running:

```
sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf
```

```
sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
```
OR
```
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

3. Install iptables

```
sudo yum install iptables-services -y
```

```
sudo systemctl start iptables
```

```
sudo systemctl enable iptables
```
	after reboot it start automatically

```
sudo systemctl status iptables		
```
	even if shows excited its ok

```
sudo iptables -L			
```
	To check table config(chains and rules)	
	By default it will give filter table here


```
sudo iptables -L -t nat
```
	To check table config for nat table

```
sudo iptables -L -t mangle
```

```
sudo iptables -L -t raw
```

```
sudo iptables -L -t security
```


4. Now Enable NATing
```
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.138.0/24 -o ens33 -j MASQUERADE
